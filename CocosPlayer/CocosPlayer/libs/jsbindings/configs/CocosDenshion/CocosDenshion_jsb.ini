# options:

#   ignore                 This method will be ignored.
#   callback               This method is a callback. It will be invoked from Objective-C
#   no_swizzle             It means that the callback function is an optional protocol and should not be "swizzled" because there is no implementation for it.
#   variadic_2_array       It means that all arguments are variadic, and an Array will be created with them
#   merge:name | name...   List of methods names that should be merged with this method as well.
#   manual                 It means that its implementation won't be autogenerated. It is implemented manually
#
#  Regular expressions are supported in the Class names, but not in the Method names

# Struct properties
# options:
