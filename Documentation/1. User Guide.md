# CocosBuilder - User Guide

With CocosBuilder you can graphically layout your Cocos2D node graphs and scenes and add them to your project with a single line of code. CocosBuilder is built around a plug-in system that allows the addition of almost any type of Cocos2D objects. By default, the following objects are supported _CCNode_, _CCLayer_, _CCLayerColor_, _CCLayerGradient_, _CCSprite_, _CCMenu_, _CCMenuItemImage_, _CCLabelBMFont_, _CCLabelTTF_, _CCParticleSystem_.


## Working in CocosBuilder

First off you will need to create a project-file for your CocosBuilder project. You can add the project file to the directory where you keep your resources, or you can setup the project to look for resources in different locations.

When creating a new document, make sure it is in one of the directories specified in your project settings. Only assets in these directories will show up in the program. The stage size can be up to a million points. The center of origin option will tell if the stage's origin is set to the bottom left corner or the center of the stage. You can change the stage size and origin at any time in the View menu.

Use the selection tool to select objects to change their properties. Hold down the command key and drag the stage to instantly switch to the scroll view tool. Add objects by using the Object -> Add Object menu. You can also add CCSprite's by dragging images from the Image Assets palette to the stage. If you drop images on a CCMenu they will automatically be added as CCMenuItemImages.

Edit the objects you have added by selecting them. If the object you have clicked on is obscured by another object, you can use the Select Behind option in the Object menu right after clicking. When an object is selected its properties will show up on the right side of the main window. Any updates you make in the properties view will be immediately reflected in your objects. You can move, rotate and scale objects by dragging their transform handles, it's also possible to nudge them by using cmd-arrowkeys.


## Loading scenes and nodes

CocosBuilder documents, or ccb-files, needs to be published into a compact binary format, ccbi, before they can be loaded into your application. Once published they can be easily loaded with a single line of code. To load a node graph, add the CCBReader.h and CCBReader.m files to your Cocos2D project, then call the _nodeGraphFromFile:_ method as follows.

    CCNode* myNode = [CCBReader nodeGraphFromFile:@"MyNodeGraph.ccbi"];

You may need to cast the returned value depending on what sort of object is the root node in your ccbi-file and how you will use it in your code. For instance, if you load a CCParticleSystem, use the following code.

    CCParticleSystem* myParticles = (CCParticleSystem*) [CCBReader nodeGraphFromFile:@"MyParticleSystem.ccbi"];

For your convenience, CCBReader can also wrap your node graph in a scene. To load your ccbi-file in a scene call _sceneWithNodeGraphFromFile:_

    CCScene* myScene = [CCBReader sceneWithNodeGraphFromFile:@"MyScene.ccbi"];


## Using custom classes

The way you can link your code with CocosBuilder is to use custom classes. To assign a custom class to an object in CocosBuilder, just select the object then enter the name of your custom class in the property inspector. Remember that your custom class needs to be a sub class of the selected object. When loading the ccbi-file CCBReader will initialize your custom class using the super class's _init_ method, then set all of the objects properties. If you need to do any extra initialization of your object after the properties are set, CCBReader will call the _didLoadFromCCB_ method.


## Linking member variables

References to objects in your ccbi-file can be linked to member variables when the file is loaded. These member variables can be either in the root node of the document, in which case it must have been assigned a custom class. You can also assign them to a custom object, which is optionally passed as the _owner_ object to the CCBReader.

To load ccbi-file and assign members to it's owner, the node graph needs to be loaded by calling either the _nodeGraphFromFile:owner:_ or the _sceneWithNodeGraphFromFile:owner:_ methods.

To link an object, simply declare them in the header file, either in the object you plan to pass as the owner or in the custom class of your document root object. Select the object in CocosBuilder, under Code Connections change the _Don't assign_ popup menu to either _Doc_ root var or _Owner var_. Then enter the name of your member variable to the right of the popup menu.


## Adding callbacks to buttons

To add a callback when a CCMenuItemImage is tapped, simply select the CCMenuItemImage in CocosBuilder, then add the name of the method you want to call in the _Selector_ field. Set the target either to the _Document root_ or the _Owner_.


## Publishing your project

By default, CocosBuilder is set up to compile and copy your ccb-files and your resources to a destination directory you specify in your project settings. When publishing, only changed files will be copied.

### Publish to zip-file

You have the option to publish to a zip file. If this option is used a zip file called ccb.zip will be placed in your destination directory. To be able to load the zip-file in your code you need to:

1. Include the SSZipArchive classes, in addition to the CCBReader, in your Xcode project.
2. In your project's build settings, add CCB\_ENABLE\_UNZIP to your _Preprocessor Macros_.
3. Replace cocos2d's default CCFileUtils class by calling [CCBFileUtils sharedFileUtils] before your cocos2d is loaded (you will need to import CCBReader.h to do this).
4. Unpack the zip file by calling [CCBReader unzipResources:@"ccb.zip"]

### Flatten file paths

In the project settings, you can choose to flatten file paths. If you do this, all file paths in the exported ccbi-files will be flattened (eg mySubDirectory/myImage.png will be transformed to myImage.png). If you use the zip option in combination, the files will be copied to a single directory within the zip file. If you are publishing without the zip option, the file structure will still be kept when copying resources to their destination. So when the resources are added in Xcode, they need to be added as yellow folders (which is usually the default option). If you choose not to flatten the paths you should add your resources as blue folders in Xcode.

## Autoring for multiple resolutions

In CocosBuilder 2 it is now possible to support multiple resolutions (iPhone/iPad and Android resolutions) in one ccb-file. When creating a new ccb-file, select the resolutions that you want to support.

1. Select the root node in your file and set it to 100% x 100%, this will make the node fill up the entire screen of your device.
2. When placing objects a children to the root node there are several positioning alternatives. You can use a percentage of the parent nodes content size (50, 50 would place the child at the center of the screen).
3. For objects where the content size can be set (CCNode, CCScale9Sprite, etc) you can set the content size in percent of the parent container, or as an inset of the parents container.

The best way to get more familiarized with the options for multiple resolutions is to check out the example files which are all made to work on both iPhone and iPad.

## Next steps

If you are familiar with Cocos2D, using CocosBuilder should be easy and straight forward. To get started, download the example to see how you can integrate CocosBuilder node graphs with your code.


## More documentation needed

More documentation for CocosBuilder is badly needed. If you want to contribute, please contact vlidholt@zynga.com
